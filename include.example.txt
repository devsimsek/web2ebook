# Web2Ebook - Example Include List
# Copyright (c) devsimsek
#
# This file contains examples of URLs and patterns to INCLUDE during crawling.
# Only URLs matching these patterns will be crawled (whitelist approach).
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored.
# Empty lines are also ignored.

# Use Case: Only crawl specific chapters
# ----------------------------------------

# Exact URL matches
# Only crawl these specific pages
https://example.com/chapter-1.html
https://example.com/chapter-2.html
https://example.com/chapter-3.html

# Pattern matching with wildcards
# --------------------------------
# Use * to match any characters
# Use ? to match single character

# Include all chapter pages (but not other pages)
https://example.com/chapter-*.html
*/chapter-*.html

# Include all pages in a specific directory
https://docs.example.com/guide/*
https://docs.example.com/tutorial/*

# Include pages with specific patterns
*-chapter-*
*/part-*/*.html

# Example: Crafting Interpreters Book
# ------------------------------------
# Only crawl actual chapter content, skip navigation
https://craftinginterpreters.com/welcome.html
https://craftinginterpreters.com/introduction.html
https://craftinginterpreters.com/a-map-of-the-territory.html
https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html
https://craftinginterpreters.com/scanning.html
https://craftinginterpreters.com/representing-code.html
https://craftinginterpreters.com/parsing-expressions.html
https://craftinginterpreters.com/evaluating-expressions.html
https://craftinginterpreters.com/statements-and-state.html
https://craftinginterpreters.com/control-flow.html

# Or use a pattern to match all chapters
# https://craftinginterpreters.com/*.html

# Example: Documentation Site
# ----------------------------
# Only include pages in the /docs/ path
https://example.com/docs/*

# Only include numbered sections
https://example.com/docs/section-*.html

# Example: Blog Series
# ---------------------
# Include all posts in a specific series
https://myblog.com/2024/*/tutorial-series-part-*.html
https://myblog.com/series/python-basics/*

# Substring matching
# ------------------
# If no wildcards, matches anywhere in URL
chapter
tutorial
guide

# Combined with Exclude
# ----------------------
# You can use both --include and --exclude together
# Include patterns are applied first, then exclude patterns
# 
# Example:
#   --include "*/chapter-*.html" --exclude "*/chapter-appendix-*.html"
#   This will include all chapters but exclude appendix chapters

# Tips
# ----
# 1. Include is a whitelist - ONLY matching URLs will be crawled
# 2. If no include patterns specified, all URLs are considered
# 3. Include is checked before exclude
# 4. Use include to target specific content areas
# 5. Combine with --max-pages to limit the crawl
